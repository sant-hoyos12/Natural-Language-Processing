    "\n",
    "Use **NLTK** to extract **features** from the **Toxic Comments** dataset.\\\n",
    "The **features** will be used to train various Machine Learning models to identify toxic comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible **features** to extract:\n",
    "* check if a word is in a list of swear words, or a list of words that are hate speech\n",
    "* check if punctuation is used in the *body* of a word rather than at the end of the sentence\n",
    "* check if words such as `a$$` are used where letters are replaced by visually similar symbols\n",
    "* sentence length i.e., how many words a sentence has\n",
    "* average word length in a sentence\n",
    "* unusually high number of exclamation marks, which could represent the author being frustrated or angry\n",
    "* etc.\n",

    "### Transforming Data Into Features\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the data as matrices/vectors. So we are transforming the dataset into a matrix representation. None of the models accept text input! Example:\\\n",
    "`X = [[0, 0], [1, 3], [2, 0], [3, 1]]`\\\n",
    "`Y = [0, 1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "`X` is a features matrix.\n",
    "`Y` is a matrix of the target classes/output the model is trying to predict. In this case we have four classes `[0, 1, 2, 3]`. The actual classes could be non-toxic, toxic, very toxic, and extremely toxic, but we have to replace them by a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `X` we have four samples/datapoints/examples, the first being `[0, 0]`. Each column in the sample corresponds to a feature.\\\n",
    "For example, the first column could be number of swear words in comment and the 2nd column could be percentage of capitalized letters in a comment. In matrix entry form:\\\n",
    "`[number of swear words in comment, percentage of capitalized letters in a comment]`\\\n",
    "Thus `[0, 0]` would correspond to a comment with zero swear words and zero capitalized letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be evaluating this section in part by how clever your choice of features were (and that you were able to extract them).\n",
    "Simple sets of features may not be as informative as complex setds of features, but simple features are easier to extract from a dataset compared to complex features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A breakdown of the marking for this task:\n",
    "* [**10 marks**] basic features gathered (trivial)\n",
    "* [**25 marks**] quality features gathered (advanced), corresponding to unusual features or clever features most would not have considered\n",
    "* [**5 marks**] formatting the features and output correctly so it can be used immediately downstream for the machine learning classifiers without any further preprocessing needing to be done at that stage"

    "> In many areas of industry and commerce, decision trees are usually the first method tried when a classification method is to be extracted from a data set. One important property of decision trees is that it is possible for a human to understand the reason for the output of the learning algorithm. (Indeed, this is a legal requirement for financial decisions that are subject to anti-discrimination laws.) This is a property not shared by some other representations, such as neural networks.\n",

    "> `DecisionTreeClassifier` is capable of both:\n",

    "### Type Of Task We Are Working With\n",
    "\n",
    "Note our task isn't a **classification** task (i.e., predicting a *discrete* value) but a **regression** task (i.e., predicting a *continuous* value). We could pursue one of two approaches:\n",
    "* keep the task as a regression task and use regression versions for each model (e.g., *decision tree regression*, *SVM for regression*, *neural network for regression*, etc.)\n",
    "* convert the regression task into a classification task where we are predicting a range of values rather than a specific value (i.e., discretizing the output space)\n",
    "\n",
    "To discretize the output we are predicting (i.e., convert a continuous value into a set of points/classes/categories), instead of predicting the temperature from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, we predict a temperature range:\n",
    "* **freezing** (0 degrees to 20 degrees Fahrenheit)\n",
    "* **cold** (20 degrees to 40 degrees Fahrenheit)\n",

    "This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of Yelp reviews using natural language processing techniques. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in understanding how people perceive different businesses and locations based on their reviews. By analyzing the sentiment of the reviews, you can identify patterns and trends in people's opinions and experiences, and gain insights into what factors drive positive or negative reviews. For example, you may find that people tend to give positive reviews to businesses that offer good customer service or have a friendly atmosphere, while negative reviews may be driven by factors such as poor quality of food or service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the project can be extended to include feature extraction techniques to identify key topics or themes mentioned in the reviews, such as food, service, ambiance, and location. By analyzing the frequency and sentiment of these topics across different businesses and locations, you can gain a deeper understanding of what aspects of a business or location are most important to people and how they influence overall customer satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project can provide valuable insights into people's opinions and experiences with businesses and locations, which can be useful for businesses, policymakers, and researchers alike."

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on a real-world dataset of Yelp reviews. The NLP techniques used in this project include tokenization, stop word removal, frequency distribution, named entity recognition, and parts-of-speech tagging.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project focused on extracting useful features from the Yelp review dataset to build a Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis. The results show that the classifier performs well on the dataset with F1 scores ranging from 0.92 to 0.93 for different sizes of the dataset. The precision and recall scores are also high, indicating that the classifier is able to accurately identify both positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the project highlights the importance of evaluating the performance of a model on different sizes of data. The results showed that the classifier was able to perform better as the size of the dataset increased, which emphasizes the importance of having a large and diverse dataset for training and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to performance metrics, the project also employed a variety of visualizations to help communicate the results in an easily understandable way. The visualizations produced include a bar chart of the precision, recall, and F1 score of the classifier, a pie chart of the distribution of sentiment labels in the dataset, and a bar chart of the frequency of the most common words in the dataset. These visualizations could be useful for presenting the findings of the project to a wider audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project provides a comprehensive example of sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques on a real-world dataset, and demonstrates the importance of evaluating the performance of models using a variety of metrics and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you.\n"
